									My name is Patrick Salsbury and I am a Data Science Major at the University of California, San 
									Diego after transferring from De Anza College where I obtained my Associates in Computer Science. As 
									someone who has always loved mathematics and programming, developing an interest in Data Science and 
									Data Engineering was a natural pathway for me. With rate that technology is evolving today, I think
									it is fascinating how businesses are discovering new ways to utilize big data and it excites me even 
									more as I hope to dig deeper into the industry.

									<h2>Additional Information</h2>
									<p>Besides all of my career aspirations and technology interests I love to enjoy my other hobbies:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Reading - I recently started investing time reading self-improvement books because of how much I
											find myself benefitting from them. My favorite ones are "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by
											Dale Carnegie and "Atomic Habits" by James Clear.
										</li>
										<li>Gyming - One of the ways I manage to keep myself active is by going to the gym on a daily basis(ideally).
											It is a habit that I have had since Highschool and I use it as one of the few ways I am able to set goals and 
											track progress.
										</li>
										<li>Thrifting/Upcycling - Ever since I moved to San Diego I developed a passion for sustainability. Buying clothes 
											second-hand and then transforming them using my sewing machine is one of my favorite hobbies. Not only am I able 
											to save a lot of money, but I am also preventing myself from buying cheap clothing from fast-fashion businesses.
										</li>
										<li>Video Games - Although I don't have as much time ever since I went to college, I will always be a gamer at heart. I 
											grew up trying to find time to play PC games on my older brother's computer and now I use it as a way to stay in contact 
											with old friends while allowing myself to relax. Some of my favorite games include: League of Legends and CSGO.
										</li>
